Testing of a method for vendor branch tracking.

Method used:

  * Created a 'vendor' branch off base of repository
     * note: may be able to do with no parent
  * Create the structure we want for all deps in that branch
  * Keep copies of all vendor drops in that branch in the directory structure we want
  * Merge 'vendor' into 'dev' to get all changes

  git checkout vendor
  git pull
  git checkout dev
  git merge --no-ff -m "Merge in of package x.y.z from vendor" vendor
  git push                    # To upload to server

  * As updates happen:
     * Go into vendor
     
git checkout vendor
cd deps

# First time
unzip package.x.y.z.zip
mv package.x.y.z package
git add package
git commit -a -m "Import of Package X.Y.Z"
git push origin vendor

# Second time
rm -rf package
unzip package.x.y.z.zip
mv package.x.y.z package
# Make sure files are in place
git commit -a -m "Import of Package X.Y.Z"
git push origin vendor
