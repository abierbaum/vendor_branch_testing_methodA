Testing of a method for vendor branch tracking.


Method used:

  * Created a 'vendor' branch off base of repository
     * note: may be able to do with no parent
  * Create the structure we want for all deps in that branch
  * Merge 'vendor' into 'dev' to get all changes
  * As updates happen:
     * Go into vendor
